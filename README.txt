Readme for the code for Suh & Thornton et al, 2024.

This repository consists of two scripts:
FOR_PAPER_Fig2G.m
FOR_PAPER_Fig6.m

Run these to generate the model results pertaining to Figure 2G or Figure 6.

It includes two additional functions files:
construct_2D_model.m - the ODE model of cell movements
get_pattern_inds.m - a helper function to find boundaries of an optogenetic pattern

Finally, it contains 3 .mat files. Two are the ODE simulation results generated by
FOR_PAPER_Fig2G.m and FOR_PAPER_Fig6.m. The last one, illuminati_pattern.mat, is the
2D light pattern used to generate the spatial results in Figure 6.
